            <h2>What is TED?</h2>
            <p>
              Centered around topics like compact disks, e-books, and fractal
              mapping of coastlines, TED (Technology, Entertainment, and Design)
              has evolved into a global beacon of creativity and intellect.
              Initially featuring a narrow range of panelists, TED gradually
              broadened its scope to include business magnates, scientists, and
              philosophers. TED's influence extends beyond its flagship event,
              spawning a diverse array of sister initiatives such as TED-Ed
              educating people through engaging animations, TEDGlobal, a
              traveling conference held in various locales, and the TED Prize,
              offering recipients the opportunity to catalyze positive change.
              TED has since embraced inclusivity, welcoming all into its fold
              and continually inspiring progress.

            <h2>What is TEDx?</h2>
            <p>
              TEDx is an initiative to promote 'ideas worth spreading' in local
              communities across the world. Steered by passionate individuals,
              TEDx events aim to infuse the spirit of TED at the grassroot level
              through a series of independently organised events. These events
              are aimed at bringing new ideas and stories to the society so as
              to inspire and spark meaningful conversations. These events, under
              the umbrella of TED, adhere to set of prescribed guidelines
              provided alongwith the license. More than 3000 events are held as
              part of TEDx each year.
